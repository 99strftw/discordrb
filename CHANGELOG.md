# Changelog
## 1.4.8
* The `User` class now has the methods `add_role` and `remove_role` which add a role to a user and remove it, respectively.
* All data classes now have a useful `==` implementation.
* **The `Game` class and all references to it were removed**. Games are now only identified by their name.

### Bugfixes
* When a role is deleted, the ID is now obtained correctly. (#30)

## 1.4.7
* Presence event handling is now divided into two separate events; `PresenceEvent` to handle online/offline/idle statuses and `PlayingEvent` to handle users playing games.

* `Message` now has a useful `to_s` method that just returns the content.

### Bugfixes
* The `TypingEvent` `user` property is now initialized correctly.

## 1.4.6
