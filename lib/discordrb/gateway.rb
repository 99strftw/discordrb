  module Opcodes
    # **Received** when Discord dispatches an event to the gateway (like MESSAGE_CREATE, PRESENCE_UPDATE or whatever).
    # The vast majority of received packets will have this opcode.
    DISPATCH = 0

    # **Two-way**: The client has to send a packet with this opcode every ~40 seconds (actual interval specified in
    # READY or RESUMED) and the current sequence number, otherwise it will be disconnected from the gateway. In certain
    # cases Discord may also send one, specifically if two clients are connected at once.
    HEARTBEAT = 1

    # **Sent**: This is one of the two possible ways to initiate a session after connecting to the gateway. It
    # should contain the authentication token along with other stuff the server has to know right from the start, such
    # as large_threshold and, for older gateway versions, the desired version.
    IDENTIFY = 2

    # **Sent**: Packets with this opcode are used to change the user's status and played game. (Sending this is never
    # necessary for a gateway client to behave correctly)
    PRESENCE = 3

    # **Sent**: Packets with this opcode are used to change a user's voice state (mute/deaf/unmute/undeaf/etc.). It is
    # also used to connect to a voice server in the first place. (Sending this is never necessary for a gateway client
    # to behave correctly)
    VOICE_STATE = 4

    # **Sent**: This opcode is used to ping a voice server, whatever that means. The functionality of this opcode isn't
    # known well but non-user clients should never send it.
    VOICE_PING = 5

    # **Sent**: This is the other of two possible ways to initiate a gateway session (other than {IDENTIFY}). Rather
    # than starting an entirely new session, it resumes an existing session by replaying all events from a given
    # sequence number. It should be used to recover from a connection error or anything like that when the session is
    # still valid - sending this with an invalid session will cause an error to occur.
    RESUME = 6

    # **Received**: Discord sends this opcode to indicate that the client should reconnect to a different gateway
    # server because the old one is currently being decommissioned. Counterintuitively, this opcode also invalidates the
    # session - the client has to create an entirely new session with the new gateway instead of resuming the old one.
    RECONNECT = 7

    # **Sent**: This opcode identifies packets used to retrieve a list of members from a particular server. There is
    # also a REST endpoint available for this, but it is inconvenient to use because the client has to implement
    # pagination itself, whereas sending this opcode lets Discord handle the pagination and the client can just add
    # members when it receives them. (Sending this is never necessary for a gateway client to behave correctly)
    REQUEST_MEMBERS = 8

    # **Received**: The functionality of this opcode is less known than the others but it appears to specifically
    # tell the client to invalidate its local session and continue by {IDENTIFY}ing.
    INVALIDATE_SESSION = 9

    # **Received**: Sent immediately for any opened connection; tells the client to start heartbeating early on, so the
    # server can safely search for a session server to handle the connection without the connection being terminated.
    # As a side-effect, large bots are less likely to disconnect because of very large READY parse times.
    HELLO = 10

    # **Received**: Returned after a heartbeat was sent to the server. This allows clients to identify and deal with
    # zombie connections that don't dispatch any events anymore.
    HEARTBEAT_ACK = 11
